the facts donï¿½t add up for human-caused global warming 
the facts donï¿½t add up for human-caused global warming The first five months of 2014 have been the coldest since the National Weather Service began keeping records in 1888 . 
"if ï¿½climate changeï¿½ alarmists got out more , they might have noticed . "
"between 1979 ï¿½ when weather satellites started measuring temperatures in the lower troposphere ï¿½ and 1997 , they rose about 1.1 degrees Celsius 1.98 degrees Fahrenheit . "
"temperatures stopped rising then , have fallen since 2012 . "
the ï¿½pauseï¿½ in warming 212 months is now longer than the warming trend was 211 months . 
the earth has warmed about 16 degrees F since the last ice age . 
the net increase since 1979 ï¿½ 0.19 degrees C 0.34 F ï¿½ is well within the range of natural fluctuation . 
"so why , as President Barack Obama says so often , do 97 percent of scientists agree climate change is ï¿½real , man-made , and dangerous ? ï¿½ They donï¿½t . "
this bogus stat is derived from two questions University of Illinois researchers 
"this bogus stat is derived from two questions University of Illinois researchers asked in a survey of earth scientists in 2008 : 1. ï¿½When compared with pre-1800s levels , do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen , fallen , or remained relatively constant ? ï¿½ 2. ï¿½Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures ? ï¿½ The researchers culled from 3,146 responses those of 79 climate scientists whoï¿½d been published in peer reviewed journals . "
Seventy-six answered ï¿½risenï¿½ to the first question ; 75 ï¿½yesï¿½ to the second . 
"temperatures have risen since the Little Ice Age ended around 1870 , skeptics agree . "
most think the activities of humans have some effect on them . 
"the key question is whether that effect is big enough to do harm , but thatï¿½s not what the scientists were asked . "

97.1 percent endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming 
"97.1 percent endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming , ï¿½ they concluded in a paper last May . "
"which is as meaningless as the ï¿½consensusï¿½ in the two-question survey , for the same reason . "
skeptics agree humans cause some warming . 
Mr. Cook et .

"included papers by prominent skeptics Willie Soon , Craig Idso , Nocola Scafetta , Nir Shaviv , Nils-Axel Morner and Alan Carlin in their 97.1 percent ï¿½consensus.ï¿½ Only 41 papers 0.3 percent explicitly state support for Mr. Cookï¿½s assertion that humans have caused most of the warming since 1950 "
"included papers by prominent skeptics Willie Soon , Craig Idso , Nocola Scafetta , Nir Shaviv , Nils-Axel Morner and Alan Carlin in their 97.1 percent ï¿½consensus.ï¿½ Only 41 papers 0.3 percent explicitly state support for Mr. Cookï¿½s assertion that humans have caused most of the warming since 1950 , former Delaware state climatologist David Legates and three colleagues found in a peer reviewed study last September . "
"ï¿½It is astonishing that any journal could have published a paper claiming a 9 percent climate consensus when on the authorsï¿½ own analysis the true consensus was well below 1 percent , ï¿½ Mr. Legates said . "
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 285 parts per million 250 years ago to about 380 ppm today . 
"CO2 is a ï¿½greenhouseï¿½ gas -- it holds heat in the atmosphere -- so if humans are generating more , it should have a warming effect . "
but probably not much of one . 
greenhouse gases comprise less than 1 percent of the earthï¿½s atmosphere ; carbon dioxide is less than 4 percent of greenhouse gases ; 96 percent of CO2 in the atmosphere was put there by Mother Nature . 
"compared to variations in solar radiation and other natural forces , the effect of greenhouse gases on climate is trivial . "
ï¿½There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide 
"ï¿½There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gases is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earthï¿½s atmosphere and disruption of the Earthï¿½s climate , ï¿½ says a petition signed by more than 31,000 American scientists in climate-related disciplines . "
Thatï¿½s rather more than 79 or 41 . 
there is no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming 
"there is no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming , and there shouldnï¿½t be . "
"ï¿½If itï¿½s science , it isnï¿½t consensus , ï¿½ said Mr . "
"soon , a solar expert at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . "
"ï¿½If itï¿½s consensus , it isnï¿½t science.ï¿½ Scientists search for truth by observation and experimentation , not by taking polls . "
consensus is a political concept . 
the skeptics are true to the scientific method . 
the abusers of science are those who politicize it .
