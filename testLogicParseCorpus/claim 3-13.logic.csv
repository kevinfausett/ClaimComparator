"Whos the GOAT , LeBron or Michael ? "
"breaking down the argument , and making a call . "
this is the time 
or is Michael Jordan still the GOAT ? 
"this is the time of year when we watch the NBA playoffs and ask , Has LeBron James finally seized the Greatest player Of All-Time title , or is Michael Jordan still the GOAT ?  They missed sharing the court by only one season . "
"michael , 55 , played his final season in 2002-03 . "
"LeBron , 33 , played his first season in 2003-04 . "
"but by Michaels final season he no longer was Michael , and in LeBrons first season he had yet to become LeBron . "
"michael is quicker , LeBron bigger and stronger . "
michael played better defense . 
LeBron is by far the better passer . 
michael has won six NBA championships . 
LeBron has won three . 
what would you give to watch them go at each other in their primes ? 
"speaking of which , when does LeBrons prime expire ? "
"no tricks , all treats ! "

he also averages 9.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists . 
"only two players in these playoffs have more assists than LeBron , and both are point guards  Rajon Rondo of the New Orleans Pelicans averages 12.9 , and John Wall of the Washington Wizards averaged 11.5 . "
"going into Game 5 of the Golden State Warriors-New Orleans series , Golden State forward Draymond Green also was averaging 9.0 . "
LeBron is 11th all-time in assists . 
"the 10 players in front of him are guards , as are the14 players behind him . "
there was a time when defenses would step back and invite LeBron to shoot from the outside . 
COVERED 
"defenses cant do that anymore , as LeBrons 34.3 points attest . "
but the beauty of LeBrons game is his forays to the basket . 
speed and strength come together and hes suddenly the Norfolk Southern . 
"take a charge against LeBron , if hes called for one , and you should win a prize . "
COVERED 
eight seconds remained in Game 3 of the Cleveland Cavaliers-Toronto 
"eight seconds remained in Game 3 of the Cleveland Cavaliers-Toronto Raptors series , and Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue pulled a Roy Williams and did not call a timeout , which meant the Cavaliers had to drive the length of the court . "
it meant LeBron had to drive the length of the court . 
so he did . 
he ignored the double team 
"he ignored the double team , splitting it . "
toronto calls itself The North . 
LeBron was The Left . 
"you knew he would , and not far from the Toronto bench put up a soft one-hander off the glass "
"he drove to the left of the basket , which you knew he would , and not far from the Toronto bench put up a soft one-hander off the glass and into the hoop for the winning basket . "
"I suspect that the older you are , the more likely "
"I suspect that the older you are , the more likely you are to consider Michael the GOAT . "
we tend to favor the player that was in his prime when we were . 
I thought Muhammad Ali was the best heavyweight I had ever seen . 
my dad said Joe Louis 
my dad said Joe Louis was . 
my kids said Mike Tyson 
my kids said Mike Tyson was . 
"then we watched Tyson dine on Evander Holyfields right ear , and they immediately switched their allegiance to Ali . "
"I like to think that they would have , anyway . "
one of the qualities that distinguished Michael is his poise . 
"when the game was being decided , he decided it . "
"the deeper into the playoffs he advanced , the better he became "
"the deeper into the playoffs he advanced , the better he became . "
"in the finals , he was stone cold years before wrestler Steve Austin claimed the name . "
michael made six championships and won them all . 
not one of went seven games . 
Thats as stunning a statistic as youre going to find . 
"LeBron , too , is clutch . "
the shot off the glass 
the shot off the glass is his second game-winning basket in the first two rounds of the playoffs . 
but this number will haunt him : In the finals 
"but this number will haunt him : In the finals , he has a record of 3-5 . "
"michael , 6-6 , played at about 195 pounds ; "
"michael , 6-6 , played at about 195 pounds ; LeBron , 6-8 , plays at 250 pounds . "
jordan played 15 seasons . 
this season is LeBrons 15th . 
"in Michaels 15th season , his game had worn out . "
LeBron is as good as hes ever been . 
"along with his outside shot , hes added the fadeaway , and more than at any time in his career hes willing to take the shot that will win , or fail to win , the game . "
"for 15 NBA seasons , LeBron has dragged his 250 or so pounds up and down the court , and hes still the best player in the world . "
I was leaning toward LeBron being the best Ive seen . 
then I went back and looked at film of Michael . 
watch him . 
"A player of extraordinary quickness , he played as if he was offended when an opponent dared guard him or try to score against him . "
I cant imagine anybody 
I cant imagine anybody being better . 
so I contend that Michael is still the GOAT . 
"but if you dont believe the call is close , you havent been watching Cleveland . "
