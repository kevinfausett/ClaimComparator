brazil Elects Far-Right Authoritarian Jair Bolsonaro As President âBrazilâs Trumpâ â who has praised dictatorship and promised a âcleansingâ of his political opponents â will take charge of the worldâs fourth-largest democracy . 
the rise of right-wing movements and parties across the globe took a giant and dangerous leap forward Sunday when far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won Brazilâs presidential election . 
"bolsonaro , a federal congressman for Rio de Janeiro who formerly served as an Army officer , has praised the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 and has expressed a fondness for authoritarians past and present . "
he defeated former SÃ£o 
he defeated former SÃ£o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workersâ Party to win the runoff phase of the election . 
"with nearly all votes counted , Bolsonaro had captured more than 55 percent of the vote Sunday and been declared the winner by multiple Brazilian news outlets . "
"bolsonaro and Haddad faced off as the top two vote-getters in the first round of voting on Oct. 7 , in which Bolsonaro fell just short of winning a majority . "
his victory will put Brazil 
"his victory will put Brazil , the fourth-largest democracy in the world and the largest in Latin America , in the hands of a far-right figure who has expressed little appreciation for democratic governance and has consistently aimed violent rhetoric at black Brazilians , LGBTQ people , women and indigenous people . "

bolsonaro was stabbed during a campaign event in September and spent much of the electionâs final two months campaigning from a hospital bed . 
he will now take the reins of a beleaguered and discontented country . 
"over the last four years , Brazil has experienced a deep economic recession that it has struggled to escape , a sharp uptick in violent crime that has resulted in 60,000 homicides annually , and a widespread political corruption probe that has implicated hundreds of politicians from across the political spectrum . "
"its last presidential election in 2014 , one president , Dilma Rousseff , has been impeached ; another former president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , has been imprisoned on corruption charges ; and its current president , Michel Temer , has been linked to a political bribery scheme . "
"since its last presidential election in 2014 , one president , Dilma Rousseff , has been impeached ; another former president , Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , has been imprisoned on corruption charges ; and its current president , Michel Temer , has been linked to a political bribery scheme . "
"the resulting discontent with Brazilâs establishment parties , and especially the left-wing Workersâ Party , eroded faith among the electorate and paved the way for a candidate like Bolsonaro , who pitched himself as a savior who alone could âsaveâ Brazil . "
"but rather than solve Brazilâs woes , a Bolsonaro who follows through on his harshest proposals and rhetoric would likely rule as a neo-fascist , having promised last week to âcleanseâ Brazil of his opponents on the left . "
he could soon offer a harsh lesson in how elite failure and political discontent can cause a modern democracy to collapse . 
âHeâs not kind of a dictator 
"âHeâs not kind of a dictator , he is a dictator , â Monica de Bolle , the director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University , told HuffPost last month . "
Bolsonaroâs rise to power was inspired by and modeled off of the ascent of similar leaders in Europe and the United States . 
he has even earned â and embraced â the nickname 
"he has even earned â and embraced â the nickname âBrazilâs Donald Trump.â Bolsonaro used social media to make an end-run around Brazilâs traditional media sources , which he decried as âfake newsâ even as his campaign and supporters used WhatsApp and Facebook to spread baseless rumors and reports about his opponents . "
bolsonaro ran a nationalistic 
"bolsonaro ran a nationalistic , identity-based campaign that promoted and thrived off of racial and social backlash , particularly against the Workersâ Party and Brazilâs most marginalized populations . "
he has promised to stop âcoddlingâ groups like LGBTQ and black Brazilians and to rid Brazil of âforeign ideologiesâ â by which he means leftism of any variety . 
"bolsonaro also benefited from his position as the strongest candidate for Brazilians looking for an alternative to the Workersâ Party , which held the presidency from 2003 to 2016 under da Silva and Rousseff . "
"the PT , as the party is known , oversaw both Brazilâs economic explosion during da Silvaâs tenure and the bust that occurred under Rousseff . "
the countryâs economic woes and the partyâs links to corruption â including da Silvaâs 
the countryâs economic woes and the partyâs links to corruption â including da Silvaâs 2017 conviction on bribery charges â eroded faith in the partyâs ability to govern and inspired fierce opposition to the potential return of PT governance among many Brazilians . 
"still , da Silva led pre-election polling for most of the last year before he was banned from running because of the corruption charge . "
haddad replaced him atop the Workersâ Party ticket . 
"those elites , however , will not likely face the harshest and most predictable outcome of his victory on Sunday : more violence in politics and beyond . "
bolsonaro has promised to further militarize 
bolsonaro has promised to further militarize public security and hand Brazilâs police â already among the worldâs deadliest â âcarte blancheâ to kill alleged criminals on sight . 
that could exacerbate a drug war in which the overwhelming majority of victims of homicides and police killings are young black men . 
some Brazilian activists have already deemed the violence 
some Brazilian activists have already deemed the violence a âblack genocide.â His rhetoric against women and LGBTQ people and threats to roll back protections for them could also only worsen the plight of those groups in a country that already experiences high levels of femicide and anti-gay violence . 
"bolsonaro has called Brazilâs era of military dictatorship a âglorious periodâ for the country , and his running mate , a retired Army general , has refused to rule out the potential return of military rule . "
bolsonaro also has a long history of advocating for violence against his political opponents . 
"in the days before the election , he said the country would experience a âcleansing never before seen in Brazilâ â those on the left , he said , âcan either get out or go to jail.â In the same speech , he threatened to imprison Haddad , shut down human rights organizations , arrest leaders of other prominent leftist movements , and pull funding from Folha de SÃ£o Paulo , one of Brazilâs largest newspapers . "
"despite the comparisons to Trump , Bolsonaro more closely resembles Rodrigo Duterte , the president of the Philippines whose deadly expansion of the countryâs drug war has led to an estimated 20,000 extrajudicial killings at the hands of law enforcement . "
"but despite widespread protests against him in recent weeks , Bolsonaro could enjoy support for his policies at home . "
brazil exhibits higher tolerance for the concept of authoritarianism and more support for police and state violence than many of its democratic peers . 
swaths of voters remained unconvinced or unmoved by Bolsonaroâs violent and anti-democratic rhetoric . 
"Bolsonaroâs small , right-wing Social Liberal Party , meanwhile , won 51 seats in the national congress during the first-round elections in early October , more than it ever had before . "
and his allies were projected to win key governorships 
and his allies were projected to win key governorships and state-level elections Sunday . 
the implications of Bolsonaroâs victory will stretch well beyond Brazilâs borders . 
his proposals to shutter environmental agencies and open the Amazon rainforest to mining and agricultural interests could have devastating effects on the global fight against climate change . 
"of the countryâs size and influence in the world , the rise of a right-wing authoritarian there could be a clear sign that liberal democracy is facing a full-scale global crisis . "
"and because of the countryâs size and influence in the world , the rise of a right-wing authoritarian there could be a clear sign that liberal democracy is facing a full-scale global crisis . "
âI tend not to buy into this idea 
"âI tend not to buy into this idea that weâve entered into a global democratic recession , â Harvard political scientist Steven Levitsky said of Bolsonaroâs potential election earlier this year . "
"âBut if [ Brazil ] suffers a democratic erosion , I would change my tune a lot.â "
