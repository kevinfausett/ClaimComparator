LeBron James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers past the Boston Celtics to advance to the 2018 NBA Finals 
a debate has raged across the internet 
"since LeBron James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers past the Boston Celtics to advance to the 2018 NBA Finals , a debate has raged across the internet : who is better , James or Michael Jordan ? "
the issue has not escaped 
"the issue has not escaped the notice of the Blazers Edge Mailbag , so lets settle it , Settling the LeBron James vs Michael Jordan Question Who was the greatest of all time ? "
depends what greatest means . 
"dave , LeBron or MJ for GOAT ? "
Youve seen them both play . 
jordan kept us from a championship . 
LeBron has kicked us for years when were down . 
"who is better ultimately , in your opinion ? "
lawrence My first question is whether the Greatest of All Time debate has to be limited to those two . 
wilt Chamberlain might want to get a word in . 
bill Russell could vote with his championship rings . 
kareem Abdul-Jabbar still holds the record for most points scored in a career . 
"we dont identify with centers as much as wings , but plenty of dominating figures have come from the near-seven-foot ranks too . "
for the sake of argumentand its a solid onelets limit the field to just Jordan and James . 
"the debate usually derails into a few ditches : Jordan won six championships and James , so far , only three . "
that ends the discussion for some . 
"then again , Jordans teams were stronger , both empirically and in relation to the rest of the league in their respective eras . "
the NBA features far better athletes playing more precise schemes now than it did in Jordans time . 
"on the other hand , Jordan-era defenders were allowed to lay hands and bodies on people in ways that would draw fouls and ejections nowadays . "
"when , Back in my day ...  meets , Everything old is , by definition , inferior ,  nobody wins . "
people are arguing as much about generational pride and identity as the actual players involved . 
disentangling the discussion from lenses of nostalgia and innovation is all but impossible . 
Im less interested in rehashing those arguments than pointing out that they dont reveal a clear answer . 
nor are we likely to find one . 
Thats half the fun . 
the best place to start may be the commonalities between the players . 
both possess otherworldly talent bolstered by top-of-the-line athleticism . 
"were we to construct ideal shooting guards and small forwards , we could hardly devise better . "
"Theyre both brilliant students of the game , elevating not just their own play , but that of the players surrounding them . "
"each has the ability to take over at will , bending the court with their gravity . "
neither can be stopped effectively for long . 
jordan was the ultimate weapon in his day . 
Hed stab at opponents incessantly on both ends of the floor . 
"teamed with Scottie Pippen , he formed the most proficient defensive duo "
"teamed with Scottie Pippen , he formed the most proficient defensive duo the league has ever seen . "
"the over/under on his point total might as well have read , As many as he wants to score tonight. He was the center of the basketball universe and he was out to prove it most every night . "
of the way he changes the terrain around him . 
"james is more like a volcano : large and ominous , feared not just for his direct blows but because of the way he changes the terrain around him . "
Hes far more likely to hit teammates with passes in critical situations than Jordan was . 
this is ironic as hes even more unstoppable when he sets his mind to it . 
"Hes bigger , stronger ... you might as well defend shifting tectonic plates . "
modern NBA players and coaches would be able to give Jordan a rougher time than his contemporaries 
modern NBA players and coaches would be able to give Jordan a rougher time than his contemporaries did . 
"the league has caught up to Michaels level of athleticism , training , and preparation . "
"in this newer , faster , taller , stronger , and more technical era , James still stands apart . "
Fast-forward Jordan to 2018 and hes still a clear MVP front-runner . 
he still vying for championships . 
but hes got catch-up work to do and more hands in his face while doing so . 
transport James back to the 1990s and he breaks the entire universe . 
even nowplaying on super teams and garage-sale teams alikeLeBron has made the NBA Finals every year this decade . 
he would have done that and more in Jordans time . 
let the two face each other one-on-one in their primes and James beats Jordan . 
"Hes too big , just as fast , and just as skilled . "
space Jam be damned ... 
"space Jam be damned ... if you have to pick a single player to go one-on-one against an alien with the fate of humankind in the balance , you pick LeBron . "
"for those reasons , Im going to say that LeBron James is the greatest player of all time . "
BUT ... 
anyone who saw Jordan playor read accounts of his career afterwardsknows that Michael had a competitive fire that has never been equaled in this league . 
"james claps talcum powder into the air at the scorers table ; Jordan ground his opponents into dust on the floor , then used it to season his T-Bone steaks . "
"if Michael and LeBron are ever hurtling towards each other on the highway in a perverse game of chicken , bet on Michael . "
"once engaged , he will not lose . "
james may be the best player of all time 
"james may be the best player of all time , but Jordan is the greatest winner of all time . "
"for many , that attribute will tip the scales towards Jordan in the GOAT debate . "
"I dont think it would make a difference in that hypothetical one-on-one game between them , but in a hypothetical discussion of what greatest means , it might . "
"if thats your take , Im good with it . "
"Lets face it , the Trail Blazers or any team would mortgage the entire franchise to have either suit up for a significant length of time . "
both players existed . 
the NBA is more remarkable because both players existed .
