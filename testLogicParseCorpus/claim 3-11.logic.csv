CLEVELAND  LeBron James is the best basketball player of all time . 
wilt Chamberlain is second . 
michael Jordan is third . 
there . 
"that wasnt so hard , was it ? "
this is just the opinion of one 
this is just the opinion of one man whos seen all the NBA stars whove played since 1962 . 
I understand that GOAT discussions 
"I understand that GOAT discussions , like Mount Rushmore arguments , are a little tired these days , and much of the debate depends on how one frames the argument estimable colleague Bob Ryan chooses to eliminate old-time centers from the discussion . "
so Ill just tell you that LeBron is the best I have seen and this does not come lightly from one who grew up in a small New England town during an era when the Celtics were champions every spring .

eleven championships in 13 seasons shuts down every argument . 
Russells Celtics routinely beat Wilts Warriors/Sixers/Lakers in the playoffs . 
but Russell had a lot more help than Wilt

and no one could match Wilts physicality 
"and no one could match Wilts physicality 7 feet 1 inch , 275 pounds and skill set . "
chamberlain forever will be the most dominant player in the history of the sport . 
he still holds 72 NBA records . 
"he won seven consecutive scoring titles and averaged 22.9 rebounds per game over 14 seasons yes , it was a different game with a lot more missed shots . "
he almost never came out of a game 
"he almost never came out of a game , leading the league in minutes eight times . "
he averaged 50.4 points per game for the 1961-62 season . 
"think about that for a second : that means that if you score only 30 on a given night , you need 70 the next game to maintain your average . "
"when Wilt decided to become a passer , he led the NBA in total assists in 1967-68 . "
wilt forced rule changes . 
we called it the key 
the paint we called it the key was widened because of Wilt . 
offensive goaltending was invented by Wilt and banned by the NBA . 
"when Wilt routinely dunked his free throws in high school , the practice was outlawed with a new regulation enforcing the free throw plane. I recall having this greatest player ever discussion with Larry Bird when Larry was in the middle of his three straight MVP seasons in the mid-1980s . "
"I can answer that ,  said Bird . "
Thats easy . 
wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points . 
bill Russell won 11 championships . 
Its right there in the record books. Dan Shaughnessy : NBA 's all-time best ? 
it 's LeBron James Bird 
it 's LeBron James Bird always had good perspective about this . 
playing against Jordan for the first time . 
he pulled me aside after playing against Jordan for the first time . 
jordan had scored 27 in a 20-point November loss to the Celtics in Chicago . 
larry said 
"larry said , That guy is the best player I ever played against . "
"you just wait. We didnt have to wait long , and Jordan "
"you just wait. We didnt have to wait long , and Jordan generally rules the GOAT discussion because of his 6-for-6 record in the Finals , his seven straight scoring titles same as Wilt , his NBA-record 30.1 career scoring average , his awesome brand creation , and his well-earned reputation as the guy you always wanted taking the last shot . "
jordan averaged 33.4 points per game in the playoffs . 
Id put the ball in Michaels hands at the end of any close game 
"Id put the ball in Michaels hands at the end of any close game , but LeBron has surpassed Jordan in my hoop dreams . "
Dont think of it as a slight of Michael . 
just think of it as the evolution of humanity . 
"LeBron is bigger , stronger , a better rebounder "
"LeBron is bigger , stronger , a better rebounder , and a better passer than Jordan . "
"unlike Michael , LeBron can guard all five positions on the floor . "
"Hes played the same number of seasons as Michael , but ranks ahead of Jordan in games , threes , rebounds , assists , triple-doubles , and all-NBA selections . "
Hes been to the Finals two more times than Jordan . 
"if youre going to punish LeBron for going 3-6 in the Finals compared with Michaels 6-0 , then youll have to take Joe Montanas 4-0 Super Bowl record over Tom Bradys 5-3 . "
"if rings are the only measure , then Sam Jones 10 is the second-best player in NBA history . "
Theres plenty to dislike about LeBron . 
he is a world-class diva 
"he is a world-class diva , always complaining to the officials  even when up by 30 against the Celtics Saturday night . "
Theres a phony air about him . 
Hes quit on a couple of occasions and no one can defend the odious Decision 
"Hes quit on a couple of occasions and no one can defend the odious Decision ,  and the subsequent not one , not two , not three Miami smokeshow . "
"but if you dont like watching him play basketball , thats on you . "
"at the age of 33 , James is clearly still the best player in the world . "
"whether he gets the votes or not , he is the MVP of every NBA season , including this years . "
close your eyes and try to imagine the 2017-18 Cavaliers without him . 
"hello , Lottery . "
and yet hes threatening to take these bums back to the Finals for a fourth straight season  which would make it eight straight Finals for James . 
the Full Monty of the LeBron experience has been on display in the first three games of this series . 
"in Game 1 he was disinterested , feeling out the situation . "
he took only 16 shots 
"he took only 16 shots , scored only 15 points , and had no interest in attacking the basket . "
"then he said he had zero level of concern. Jamess Game 2 tour de force 42 points , 12 assists , 10 rebounds was not enough to beat the Celtics . "
it reminded me of Red Auerbachs time-tested Chamberlain strategy of letting Wilt get his numbers while shutting down 
it reminded me of Red Auerbachs time-tested Chamberlain strategy of letting Wilt get his numbers while shutting down Wilts teammates and winning the game . 
LeBrons response : Well see what were made of on Saturday. The King got his teammates involved in Saturdays 30-point blowout win . 
he scored 12 of his 27 points in the first quarter 
"he scored 12 of his 27 points in the first quarter , hit 8 of 12 shots overall , and made a couple of soul-crushing blocks . "
he dished out 12 assists 
"he dished out 12 assists , several of the spectacular variety , including a wraparound , no-look , lefty special to Tristan Thompson in traffic . "
he also  without putting the ball on the floor 
"the Cleveland Plain Dealers full-page photo of the slam featured a cutline that read , No Celtics were harmed in the making of this dunk "
"he also  without putting the ball on the floor  threw down a double-clutch , reverse , two-handed dunk after taking a bounce pass from Kevin Love the Cleveland Plain Dealers full-page photo of the slam featured a cutline that read , No Celtics were harmed in the making of this dunk . "
"Not many people can do that ,  said Love . "
"just like not many people can make the full-court-rush , wrong-foot , casual off-the-window runner to beat the Raptors in Game 3 , and not many people can execute the chase-down block of Andre Iguodala that won the championship for The Land in 2016 . "
Dont hate LeBron because hes great . 
just enjoy what you are seeing and stop fighting the notion that Wilt or Michael or Larry or Russell was better . 
"in 1962 , the year Wilt averaged 50 , the Celtics beat Chamberlains Warriors in seven games in the conference finals "
"in 1962 , the year Wilt averaged 50 , the Celtics beat Chamberlains Warriors in seven games in the conference finals even though Wilt averaged 33 points and 26 rebounds for the series . "
"in the 1986 playoffs , the Celts beat the Bulls when Michael let it rain for 63 points at the Old Garden . "
LeBron is better than both . 
. 
. 
but the Celtics should still win this series .
