Brazil out of the Paris Agreement 
"brazil : Bolsonaro threatens to quit Paris climate deal De facto presidential frontrunner says he would follow Donald Trump out of the international pact , drawing criticism from the UNâs environment chief Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro is threatening to take Brazil out of the Paris Agreement if he wins the October election . "
"in an unpredictable race , the right-wing Bolsonaro is polling second behind Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , the socialist former president . "
"but âLulaâ is in jail for corruption and likely to be disqualified by the courts , leaving a scattered field . "
"at his campaign launch last month and in subsequent interviews , Bolsonaro said he would join Donald Trumpâs US and withdraw from the Paris pact . "
that stance drew ire from UN environment chief Erik Solheim .

"action on climate change would create âhealthier and wealthierâ economies , he told Climate Home News . "
âA rejection of the Paris Agreement is a rejection of science and fact 
"âA rejection of the Paris Agreement is a rejection of science and fact , â Solheim said . "
"âItâs also a false promise , because politicians who present climate action as a cost to society have got it all wrong.â Last week , Brazilâs government released a statement declaring the country had met its 2020 forest emissions target three years early . "
we can and should remain in the Paris Agreement 
"âThe policy message is that we can and should remain in the Paris Agreement because it is possible to effectively implement the commitments that have been made , â Thiago Mendes , secretary of climate change in the Environment Ministry , told Reuters . "
"the withdrawal of such an important developing country , home to the worldâs largest rainforest , would deal a blow to international climate cooperation . "
"while it has not been confirmed , Brazil was expected to host the 2019 UN climate summit . "
but Brazilian experts downplayed the likelihood of Bolsonaro carrying out his threat . 
"unlike in the US , Brazil ratified the Paris Agreement through its congress , said AndrÃ© GuimarÃ£es , head of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute Ipam . "
"âHonestly , I think that there is very little chance that [ a withdrawal ] happens , â he said . "
âMy guess is that even if Bolsonaro wins 
"âMy guess is that even if Bolsonaro wins and wants to change the deal , it will not be an easy task.â Citing research showing that Amazon deforestation could hit rainfall and therefore agriculture , GuimarÃ£es said climate action was in the national interest . "
âStopping deforestation is good business for Brazil 
"âStopping deforestation is good business for Brazil , not just for environmentalists.â Bolsonaro has not elaborated on why he opposes the Paris Agreement , but some clues can be found in his social media activity . "
"last August , Bolsonaro shared an interview with Ricardo Felicio , a geographer and prominent climate denier who disputes the basic physics of the greenhouse effect . "
the day after Trump announced his intention to quit the Paris deal 
"the day after Trump announced his intention to quit the Paris deal , Bolsonoro shared an article defending the decision entitled âthe greenhouse fablesâ . "
"Bolsonaroâs three eldest sons , all elected officials , have been more outspoken on the issue . "
"eduardo , a federal representative from the state of SÃ£o Paulo , posted a homemade video in January characterising the Paris deal as a globalist conspiracy . "
âIt doesnât make any sense 
"âIt doesnât make any sense , â he told viewers from a snowy part of the US . "
"A photograph , reportedly taken last week "
"A photograph , reportedly taken last week , shows Eduardo meeting former Trump adviser and far-right propagandist Steve Bannon in New York . "
bannon was one of the strongest White House advocates for the US to withdraw from the deal . 
"carlos , a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro , blamed the âleftist agendaâ for climate change getting media coverage in a 2016 tweet . "
he asserted â against all evidence â that the world was cooling . 
"flavio , a federal representative in Rio , has called global warming a âfraudâ . "
"it comes as Brazil faces international pressure to tackle an up-tick in deforestation , particularly from Norway , which supports forest protection efforts through the Amazon Fund . "
"last year , Norway more than halved its annual payment to $ 35 million , citing poor results . "
"in 2016 and 2017 , Brazil recorded its highest rates of tree clearance this century . "

"michel Temerâs administration has courted the beef lobby , rolling back forest protections to allow the expansion of cattle ranches , soy plantations and mines . "
ten scientists wrote in a letter to the journal Nature Climate Change last month that such moves jeopardised Brazilâs climate goals . 
âThe abandonment of deforestation control policies and the political support for predatory agricultural practices make it impossible to meet targets consistent with Brazilâs contribution to a 2C world

"climate Action Tracker notes the 2020 target , which the government claimed as an early win , was in fact already mostly achieved in 2012 , having been weakened by artificially inflating the âbusiness as usualâ baseline . "

"the outlook for meeting the tougher 2030 targets is poor based on current trends , according to analyst Paola Parra : âIt is not looking great for deforestation for the future.â Ipamâs GuimarÃ£es agreed . "
"âIt is very easy to play with numbers , â he said . "
"âAt some point in the future , the challenge for Brazil is to stop deforestation.â "
