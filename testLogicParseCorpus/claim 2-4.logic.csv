scientists Agree : Global Warming is Happening and Humans are the Primary Cause The evidence is overwhelming . 
"Record-breaking temperatures , humidity , and sea level rise , along with many other indicators , show that the Earth is warming fast , and that all the heat-trapping emissions we release into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is changing our climate . "

"the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report AR5 , written by a panel of hundreds of climate experts and scientists from member countries of the World Meteorological Organization the United Nations Environmental Programme , plus a team of external reviewers , states unambiguously : Human influence on the climate system is clear , and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-house gases are the highest in history . "
"[ ] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , and since the 1950s , many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia . "
the scientific consensus is clear . 
"building on two previous studies , a landmark 2013 peer-reviewed study evaluated 10,306 scientists to confirm that over 97 percent climate scientists agree , and over 97 percent of scientific articles find that global warming is real and largely caused by humans . "
A more recent peer-reviewed paper examined existing studies on consensus in climate research 
"A more recent peer-reviewed paper examined existing studies on consensus in climate research , and concluded that the 97 percent estimate is robust . "
"this level of consensus is equivalent to the level of agreement among scientists that smoking causes cancer  a statement that very few people , if any , contest today . "
the American public also increasingly agrees that global warming is happening . 
"A 2016 poll from Yale found that 70 percent of Americans believe global warming is happening , while record low number of Americans 12 percent say the opposite . "
A Gallup poll from 2017 showed that the number of Americans who worry a great deal about global warming has increased from 37 percent in 2016 to 45 percent in 2017 . 
"the acceptance of human-caused emissions as the cause of warming is not keeping pace with those that believe it is happening , but it is at 53 percent . "

there is no shortage of published research on the consensus of climate scientists and climate science when it comes to human-caused global warming . 
you can read about 
"in addition to the references above , you can read about how the discussion on consensus developed over time in these studies . "
many different scientific societies in the United States and numerous national academies of science from around the world have also issued statements that verify the scientific claims about human-caused warming see below . 
consensus and scientific uncertainty Climate skeptics and deniers often misrepresent scientific uncertainty to undermine climate science findings . 
it comes to scientific consensus on global warming 
"therefore , when it comes to scientific consensus on global warming , it is important to clarify what type of uncertainty exists , and what type does not : there is strong certainty on the types of impacts that global warming is causing or would be likely to cause under a given scenario for emissions , but less certainty on the exact timing and intensity of these impacts . "
"for instance , on the issue of sea level rise , we know with certainty that it will happen  it is already happening  and projections under different scenarios give us a range of possible rise . "
we dont know an exact value 
in large part it is dependent on the rate of future emissions 
"we dont know an exact value , however , for future sea level rise , because in large part it is dependent on the rate of future emissions , which is unknown . "
"if emissions continue in a business as usual fashion , the sea level rise will be closer to the higher range of projections . "
we significantly reduce emissions 
"but if we significantly reduce emissions , the rise will be closer to the lower levels of projections . "
"the same is true for how much warming will actually happen , or how much land-based ice and glaciers will melt . "
all these things are already happening 
"all these things are already happening , but future rates are not known because they , too , depend on the rate of future emissions . "
what scientists can calculate quite confidently is a narrow range of outcomes within a given scenariomeaning the likely highest and lowest values if we continue on a certain path of emissions . 
this information is critical to making smart collective choices and for planning for the future . 
uncertainties are not a reason to delay action on climate change . 
quite the contrary : those uncertainties are really a consequence of our collective choices 
"quite the contrary : those uncertainties are really a consequence of our collective choices , and a risk we must prepare for . "
you can think about it like car insurance : everyone hopes they wont be in a car 
"you can think about it like car insurance : everyone hopes they wont be in a car accident but have accident insurance anyway , even though the likelihood is very low . "
"climate adaptation and climate risk reduction are insurance against the effects of climate change , which in contrast are NOT low-probability events , but highly likely and predicted with high levels of certainty under specific conditions . "
being prepared for these scenarios is simply smart planning . 
nobody wants to be caught unaware and unprepared . 
consensus worldwide Many scientific societies and academies have released statements and studies that highlight the overwhelming consensus on climate change science .

"these observations show large-scale increases in air and sea temperatures , sea level , and atmospheric water vapor ; they document decreases in the extent of mountain glaciers , snow cover , permafrost , and Arctic sea ice . "
these changes are broadly consistent with long-understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases .
