"âI can see a better future for my son , better health , education and security , something we havenât had for years.â In the midst of an increasingly raucous atmosphere one group of young men jumped up and down chanting : âGo fuck yourselves , PT ! â Hordes of jubilant Bolsonaro supporters flocked on to Avenida Paulista , one of SÃ£o Pauloâs most important boulevards , where they sang Brazilâs national anthem and set off fireworks .

"he is our hope ! â âFor the first time we are going to have a God-fearing and genuinely right-wing president , â said Fernando Pereira , a 40-year-old physiotherapy student celebrating as fireworks exploded around him . "
âHe is the president 
"âHe is the president we have been waiting for for so long.â But Bolsonaroâs triumph will leave many millions of progressive Brazilians profoundly disturbed and fearful of the intolerant , rightwing tack their country is now likely to take . "
"over nearly three decades in politics , he has become notorious for his hostility to black , gay and indigenous Brazilians and to women , as well as for his admiration of dictatorial regimes , including the one that ruled Brazil from 1964 until 1985. âThe extreme right has conquered Brazil , â Celso Rocha de Barros , a Brazilian political columnist , told the election night webcast of PiauÃ­ magazine . "
"âBrazil now has a more extremist president than any democratic country in the world ... we donât know what is going to happen.â ClÃ³vis Saint-Clair , a Rio-based journalist who has written an unauthorised Bolsonaro biography , said he feared Brazilâs young democracy was at risk . "
âThis is a moment of great doubt and apprehension.â Saint-Clair said a cocktail of voter frustration at political sleaze and the successful demonization of the PT explained how a once widely ridiculed and peripheral firebrand had been catapulted from the political wilderness to the presidency . 
"bolsonaro voters had voted on âfeelings not factsâ and were obsessively focused on the PTâs not inconsiderable sins while refusing to recognise the advances of its 13 years in power , which ended with Dilma Rousseffâs highly controversial impeachment in 2016. âThe PT got many things right , â he said , pointing to the war on extreme poverty launched by Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , Brazilâs now jailed former president . "
Saint-Clair said he expected Bolsonaro to intensify police repression and pay scant attention to Brazilâs neediest citizens . 
âIf he follows 
"âIf he follows through on all the promises he has made , the next four years will be very difficult for the majority of the population.â Chico Paiva Avelino , whose politician grandfather , Rubens Paiva , was tortured and disappeared under Brazilâs military regime in 1971 , said he was disgusted that a man who had praised that dictatorship was on his way to the presidency . "
âIt is unacceptable 
"âIt is unacceptable that in 2018 someone can be elected off the back of this discourse , â the 31-year-old said . "
"however , for the tens of millions of voters who backed Bolsonaro , he represents change after years of economic recession and eye-watering corruption scandals that they blame on the Workersâ party , which ruled Brazil from 2003 until the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016. âWe are happy .
