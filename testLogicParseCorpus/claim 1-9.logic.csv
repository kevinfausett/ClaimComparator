the economy is a disaster

"street crime is rising , too . "
seven Brazilian cities feature in the worldâs 20 most violent . 
the national elections next month give Brazil the chance to start afresh . 
"yet if , as seems all too possible , victory goes to Jair Bolsonaro , a right-wing populist , they risk making everything worse . "

"mr Bolsonaro is the latest in a parade of populistsâfrom Donald Trump in America , to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and a left-right coalition featuring Matteo Salvini in Italy . "
"in Latin America , AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador , a left-wing firebrand , will take office in Mexico in December . "
mr Bolsonaro would be a particularly nasty addition to the club see Briefing . 
"were he to win , it might put the very survival of democracy in Latin Americaâs largest country at risk . "
brazilian bitterness Populists draw on similar grievances . 
A failing economy is oneâand in Brazil 
A failing economy is oneâand in Brazil the failure has been catastrophic . 
"in the worst recession in its history , GDP per person shrank by 10 % in 2014-16 and has yet to recover . "
the unemployment rate is 12 % . 
the whiff of elite self-dealing and corruption is another grievanceâand in Brazil 
the whiff of elite self-dealing and corruption is another grievanceâand in Brazil it is a stench . 
the interlocking investigations known as Lava Jato 
the interlocking investigations known as Lava Jato Car Wash have discredited the entire political class . 
scores of politicians are under investigation . 
"michel Temer , who became Brazilâs president in 2016 after his predecessor , Dilma Rousseff , was impeached on unrelated charges "
"michel Temer , who became Brazilâs president in 2016 after his predecessor , Dilma Rousseff , was impeached on unrelated charges , has avoided trial by the supreme court only because congress voted to spare him . "
"luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva , another former president , was jailed for corruption and disqualified from running in the election . "
"brazilians tell pollsters that the words which best sum up their country are âcorruptionâ , âshameâ and âdisappointmentâ . "
mr Bolsonaro has exploited their fury brilliantly . 
"until the Lava Jato scandals , he was an undistinguished seven-term congressman from the state of Rio de Janeiro . "
he has a long history of being grossly offensive . 
she was âvery uglyâ

he said he would not rape a congresswoman because she was âvery uglyâ ; he said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one ; and he suggested that people who live in settlements founded by escaped slaves are fat and lazy . 
"suddenly that willingness to break taboos is being taken as evidence that he is different from the political hacks in the capital city , BrasÃ­lia . "
"to Brazilians desperate to rid themselves of corrupt politicians and murderous drug dealers , Mr Bolsonaro presents himself as a no-nonsense sheriff . "
"an evangelical Christian , he mixes social conservatism with economic liberalism "

he favours the privatisation of all Brazilâs state-owned companies and âbrutalâ simplification of taxes . 
"mr Bolsonaro proposes to slash the number of ministries from 29 to 15 , and to put generals in charge of some of them . "
his formula is winning support . 
polls give him 28 % of the vote and he is the clear front-runner in a crowded field for the first round of the elections on October 7th . 
this month he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally 
"this month he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally , which put him in hospital . "
that only made him more popularâand shielded him from closer scrutiny by the media and his opponents . 
"if he faces Fernando Haddad , the nominee of Lulaâs left-wing Workersâ Party PT in the second round at the end of the month , many middle- and upper-class voters , who blame Lula and the PT above all for Brazilâs troubles , could be driven into his arms . "
the Pinochet temptation They should not be fooled . 
"in addition to his illiberal social views , Mr Bolsonaro has a worrying admiration for dictatorship . "
"he dedicated his vote to impeach Ms Rousseff to the commander of a unit responsible for 500 cases of torture and 40 murders under the military regime , which governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985 . "

"augusto Pinochet , a brutal ruler of Chile between 1973 and 1990 , was advised by the free-marketeer âChicago boysâ . "
"they helped lay the ground for todayâs relative prosperity in Chile , but at terrible human and social cost . "
brazilians have a fatalism about corruption 
"brazilians have a fatalism about corruption , summed up in the phrase ârouba , mas fazâ âhe steals , but he actsâ . "
they should not fall for Mr Bolsonaroâwhose dictum might be âthey tortured 
"they should not fall for Mr Bolsonaroâwhose dictum might be âthey tortured , but they actedâ . "
"latin America has known all sorts of strongmen , most of them awful . "
"for recent proof , look only to the disasters in Venezuela and Nicaragua . "
mr Bolsonaro might not be able to convert his populism into Pinochet-style dictatorship even if he wanted to . 
but Brazilâs democracy is still young . 
even a flirtation with authoritarianism is worrying . 
all Brazilian presidents need a coalition in congress to pass legislation . 
mr Bolsonaro has few political friends . 
", he could be driven to degrade politics "
"to govern , he could be driven to degrade politics still further , potentially paving the way for someone still worse . "
"instead of falling for the vain promises of a dangerous politician in the hope that he can solve all their problems , Brazilians should realise that the task of healing their democracy and reforming their economy will be neither easy nor quick . "
some progress has been madeâsuch as a ban on corporate donations to parties and a freeze on federal spending . 
A lot more reform is needed . 
mr Bolsonaro is not the man to provide it .
