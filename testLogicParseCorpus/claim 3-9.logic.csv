Itï¿½s tough to top perfection . 
"or , to be more accurate , the perception of perfection . "

a five-game Spurs win 
"and unlike James , who faltered badly in the 2011 Finals loss against Dallas and was below his Superman standards in 2007 a sweep by San Antonio and 2014 a five-game Spurs win , Jordan met the moment every time while taking down plenty of greats along the way . "

there is a younger generation that knows James better than Jordan . 
"if your only argument is rings should determine the GOAT , then itï¿½s neither Jordan nor James . "
"russell won 11 titles , which would make him the greatest . "
"and if you want to put Russell and Abdul-Jabbar in that group , fine . "

james and Jordan are different in many ways 
james and Jordan are different in many ways but their determination to be the best is a shared trait . 
james also plays in an era of social media and over-the-top hyper-criticism . 
imagine if Jordan played in the social media era .

"also , consider the expectations placed on James as a teen . "
