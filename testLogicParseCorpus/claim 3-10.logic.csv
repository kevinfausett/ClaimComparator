LeBron James is the greatest player of all-time Hes done it again . 
"LeBron James , the King in the East , played 48 minutes en route to his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance after beating the Boston Celtics in Game 7 at TD Garden on Sunday , 87-79 . "
bow down to the greatest player of all-time . 
much has been made of LeBrons place in history as his legacy has began to galvanize toward the end of his career . 
"the conversation has raged on about LeBron vs. Michael Jordan , or Wilt Chamberlain , or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . "
"preference varies greatly between fans , while some still pick the centrist route and say theres no simple way to compare across eras . "
"Theres been mathematical attempts to rank the two , and even MJs old teammates have said LeBron is a more complete player . "
"on Sunday , James bounced yet another Eastern Conference Finals opponent , carrying his teammates on his shoulders and playing without All-Star Kevin Love . "
there was never a doubt for many watching 
there was never a doubt for many watching Sundays matchup in Massachusetts . 
"before the final buzzer , LeBron had won 23 straight Eastern Conference playoff series . "
"his determination was absolute , and the cards were always stacked against Boston even given their postseason record at home . "
you could sort of just see it coming . 
"james was the motivating force in the first half for Cleveland , scoring 17 points while no other teammates tallied in double digits . "
"the Cavaliers shot an abysmal 12 percent from beyond the arc , and the Celtics looked like they would be able to control "
"the Cavaliers shot an abysmal 12 percent from beyond the arc , and the Celtics looked like they would be able to control the rest of the game as the crowd at home motivated them forward . "
LeBron James in games 6&7 against the NBAs #1 ranked defense : 81 PTS 26 REB 18 AST in 94 minutes .

" Conrad Kaczmarek @ ConradKaz May 28 , 2018 But Cleveland came roaring back in the second half , continuing to put on a defensive show , the kind we would not have expected of them during the regular season . "
"without Love , the Cavs had to make do with Jeff Green , who turned in a surprising performance . "
"green scored 19 points , shot 50 percent from the field , and grabbed eight rebounds . "
"in the face of a strengthening Cavaliers attack , the Celtics seems to retreat . "
"Bostons final offensive possessions in the fourth quarter were hectic , slow , and unsuccessful . "
"while the Cavaliers tried their hardest during the final eight minutes to get Al Horford switched on to LeBron in isolation sets , the Celtics surprisingly mirrored the same offensive tactics . "
"instead of playing their regular offense , or running plays to get shooters free , or trying to attack the paint against James who was in foul trouble Boston resorted to trying to exploit any mismatches found through Clevelands switches . "
the result was four field goals inside the 3-point line for LeBron in the fourth quarter 
"the result was four field goals inside the 3-point line for LeBron in the fourth quarter , as much as the entire Celtics roster combined . "
the play of the game came with 1:04 remaining in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers leading by nine . 
LeBron was out on the break 
"LeBron was out on the break , with Marcus Morris trailing behind him . "
"morris went to foul LeBron , making no obvious attempts on the ball as he grabbed onto the Cavaliers stars shoulders . "
"even with all of his might , Morris couldnt stop James from scoring while drawing the foul . "
"it was indicative of the entire fourth quarter for the Celtics , who scraped , clutched and grabbed as much as they could but did not have an answer for LeBron . "
"marcus Morris is 69 , 235 lbs and couldnt stop LeBron from behind with two full hands on his shoulders . "
"king James  too big , too strong , too good . "
the series in a gif . 
"pic.twitter.com/Dw6wxJ2ioJ  Sully Engels @ sullayyy May 28 , 2018 So here we are , with LeBron having won another Game 7 out in the Eastern Conference as he heads to another Finals . "
he probably wont match Jordans championship mark . 
but Jordan didnt match Russells . 
or Horrys . 
"or Havlicheks , either . "
"instead , we have to rely on what we see in front of our eyes combined with their dominance , weighted for context . "
"sunday nights performance should help push LeBron over Jordan , if he wasnt there already . "
"james is a more complete player , which has always been apparent , and now hes survived every challenge thats been thrown at him . "
declaring James the best player of all-time did not come because of Sundays game . 
"Its been years in the making , throughout the entirety of his 15-year career . "
the win over Boston was just an indication of his place in history . 
"the Lebron-versus-Jordan debate , and any other like it , should only be about comparing resumes . "
to not believe LeBron James is better at basketball than Michael Jordan is to basically not believe in human evolution . 
" Alden Gonzalez @ Alden_Gonzalez May 28 , 2018 LeBron has gone nuclear with 40+ point performances . "
he was part of the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history against the Golden State Warriors . 
"he beat the Indiana Pacers all by himself , in the playoffs , just this very season . "
"james has had a career season at age 33 , playing 48 minutes in the 100th game of the 2017-18 season . "
"LeBron has willed his way to yet another NBA Finals , with perhaps his worst team since the 2006-07 squad that was swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the seasons final series . "
"to add to the accomplishment , LeBron pushed this Cavaliers squad past a stunningly good team in the Celtics , on the road , and without Love . "
"james is the greatest American sports story of our generation , and hes the best player the NBA has ever seen . "
"if you disagree , thats OK . "
"Sunday night , youd be hard pressed to convince me otherwise . "
"but after Sunday night , youd be hard pressed to convince me otherwise . "
`` We 've been counted out for a long time this season . '' 
LeBron James is determined .
