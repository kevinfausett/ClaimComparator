"the climate is changing , but not just because of humans . "
here 's why that matters . 
our culture of disaster has increased ideological semantics but not informed decision-making . 
the climate is changing  the thing 
"the climate is changing  the thing is , it isnt just due to humans . "
natural forces beyond human control are also gradually affecting our climate . 
these geophysical forces are vital to understanding global warming . 
man is indeed responsible for a large portion  possibly even a majority  of global warming . 
"but also in play are complex gravitational interactions , including changes in the Earths orbit , axial tilt and torque . "
this fact needs to be included in the public debate . 
"these gravitational shifts , occurring over millennia , can influence climate patterns and ultimately lead to noticeable variations in seasons . "
"because these gravitational shifts , occurring over millennia , can influence climate patterns and ultimately lead to noticeable variations in seasons . "
"interestingly , research suggests climate change can alter the tilt of the Earth , but an unrelated change in tilt can also further change the climate . "
it is a balance-counterbalance relationship . 
changes in the Earths path around the Sun 
"changes in the Earths path around the Sun , or eccentricity , involve shifts in the orbit around the Sun from a roughly circular journey to more of an elliptical one . "
"when the Earth gradually adopts a more elliptical orbit , there are more pronounced temperatures during the summer and winter months . "
this alteration is exacerbated when the Earths axial tilt is inclined to a sharper degree than usual . 
"as this happens , it causes the North and South Poles to be positioned more directly toward the Sun . "
Havent you noticed the recent rise in irregular weather patterns ? 
this is not just 
this is not just a man-made problem . 
gradual slight variations in the Earths orbit around the Sun can strongly influence temperature extremes . 
this is important because the conversation 
"this is important because the conversation around climate change has become so politicized , we 've totally lost sight of the science  and with it , any room for bipartisanship . "
"tropical storms , for example , have been forming later in what we know as hurricane season . "
"based on my own analysis , over the past three decades , the majority of Category 3 or stronger storms to hit the United States appear from late August to early October . "
"earlier in the 20th century , storms usually occurred in June , July and early August . "
it doesnt stop there . 
"changes in seasons can also affect other types of storms , including severe winter snowstorms and tornadoes . "
recall the Storm of the Century in 1993 on the heels of Hurricane Andrew the year prior . 
"or what about the recent string of snowstorms with names like Snowpocalypse , Snowmageddon and Snowzilla dovetailing with warm-weather superstorms . "
"climate extremes are evident , and not just with hurricanes . "
the variations in the Earths orbit are known as the Milankovitch cycles  after the Serbian geophysicist 
"the variations in the Earths orbit are known as the Milankovitch cycles  after the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovic , who hypothesized this phenomenon in the 1920s . "
he discovered that variations in the Earths path around the Sun 
"he discovered that variations in the Earths path around the Sun , axial tilt and torque could together affect our climate . "
even a slight change or orientation in the precession of the Earths rotating body can cause a wobbling effect shifting torque in different areas since the planet is not a perfect sphere to some peoples surprise . 
now would seem a particularly apt time to act . 
"the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was an intense , record-setting period . "
"with several landfall hurricanes  Harvey , Irma , Jose and Maria  barreling their way through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico , devastating parts of the Leeward Islands and United States . "
"still , even President Donald J. Trump has implied the whole of idea climate change may just be a hoax . "
most Republicans seem to agree that it is not a serious problem . 
some Democrats have tried to use the frequency 
"meanwhile , while some Democrats have tried to use the frequency and intensity of storms in the hopes of highlighting the climate change conversation , even this effort has seemed muted . "
"to make effective policy , it is important for politicians and activists alike to set aside their ideological differences . "
there is now a real opportunity for new legislation 
"there is now a real opportunity for new legislation , sound environmental legislation . "
"but will we squander this unprecedented opportunity , punting the ball yet again ? "
you can bet on it . 
"given the realities of everyday life , the extent of social beliefs , political attitudes and economic perspectives vary on a wide range of policy issues . "
"to make sound and effective policy , it is important for politicians "
"to make sound and effective policy , it is important for politicians and activists alike to set aside their ideological differences and return to the basics of science , in this case , the mechanics of science . "
"all , shouldnt we be relying more heavily upon geoscientists and weather forecasters to provide evidence-based data and predictive modeling ? "
"after all , shouldnt we be relying more heavily upon geoscientists and weather forecasters to provide evidence-based data and predictive modeling ? "
risks to disasters are increasing . 
"population growth along coastlines worldwide , in addition to technological and infrastructural development , will inherently result in a concomitant increase in places prone to disasters . "
modern society relies upon government for effective response to and recovery from such events . 
change is occurring and will continue to do so . 
"as the population continues to explode and resources are consumed on a massive scale , trying to stop both is unrealistic . "
"it is more than just being unrealistic , it is simply wasting critical time . "
"I know , science isnt sexy . "
the obsession on why storms are occurring in lieu of discussing the how is leading us down a dangerous path . 
A deadly path . 
the heightened culture of disaster only feeds our attention on political banter and ideological semantics with no room for informed decision-making . 
"we get it , Mother Nature always wins . "
"so , are we now faced with the sobering lesson that little can be done , and we should just throw in the towel ? "
"no , of course not . "
we also need to have a healthy appreciation 
"though climate change is inevitable , we also need to have a healthy appreciation of the fact that climate shifts arent just limited to rapidly changing weather patterns . "
turning the corner into unexplored territory is always difficult . 
"by having a broader sense of communal resiliency  social , political and economic standing  we can manage this unavoidable pendulum of climate extremes . "
"with the recent sweeping of storms draining response efforts and budgetary resources , now is the time to set aside the theatrical shenanigans and engage in realpolitik . "
