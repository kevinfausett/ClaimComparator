5 Reasons LeBron James Is The Greatest Of All-Time

Cavaliers forward LeBron James single-handedly dominated the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals and, at age 33, is playing the best basketball of his career. Tonight is the commencement of the fourth installment of the Warriors-Cavs Finals, which resurrects the biggest debate in basketball: Is LeBron James or the Bulls' Michael Jordan the Greatest Player of All-Time?

Partisans of both players will probably never agree, and there is no tribunal to judge this case. Different eras are difficult to compare, but this analysis may give us further clarity on the debate. LeBron may have a number of years left in his career, and here are five reasons his case becomes more compelling.

1. LeBron's Statistical Advantage

While Jordan might be considered a better scorer with a more accomplished career in terms of NBA Championships, LeBron is the best all-around player, and their individual statistics only reinforce this notion. Michael has the advantage in NBA Championships, league MVPs, points per game and free-throw percentage. LeBron on the other hand beats Michael in All-NBA First-Team selections and per-game statistics for rebounds, assists, blocks and overall field goal percentage. Not to mention LeBron James is the only player in NBA history with 30,000 points, 8,000 assists and 8,000 rebounds.


LeBron's efficiency and dominance cannot be swept under the rug. His "bully ball" style on offense proves to be unstoppable, and he has continued to be a force to be reckoned with on defense; just ask Andre Iguodala and Terry Rozier, who have been on the receiving end of his trademark chase-down blocks. LeBron’s ability to not only play but dominate all five positions is reminiscent of the great Magic Johnson. The case can be made that even though Jordan averaged more points than LeBron, LeBron was a more efficient scorer in that he averaged only 2.9 fewer points on 3.3 fewer shot attempts. That is 6 to 9 points that LeBron relinquishes by not taking those shots.

2. Their Teams’ Performance Following Their Departure

When Michael Jordan decided to hang up his sneakers (for the first time) in exchange for professional baseball in 1994, nobody would have predicted the Bulls would have similar success. MJ was considered to be the athlete who set a new standard of excellence and perfection in his craft. On paper, the void that his absence had created would be a tough hurdle to overcome. The truth was quite the contrary, as the Jordan-less Bulls of 1993-94 went on to produce a 55-27 season, just two wins short of the previous season, when MJ was a part of the team.

LeBron James made the decision to depart Cleveland in 2009, when he entered into free agency. While James created a Jordan-like void on the team he was leaving, the result of his absence was far more detrimental to the Cavaliers. For the 2009-10 season, they produced an abysmal 19-63 record following an NBA-best 61-21 record season. These numbers clearly indicate whose presence was more valuable to their respective team.

3. Jordan’s More Physical but Diluted Era

While it is hotly debated that the NBA and game officials allowed for a more physical style of play when Jordan was playing, athletes nowadays are larger, faster and stronger than their predecessors. Nutrition has advanced, and James was recently on record saying he spends more than $1.5 million annually on his 6-9, 260-pound body — his most valuable asset.

The other factor that is commonly overlooked is the fact that Jordan was a beneficiary of the NBA’s expansion teams — twice. From 1988 to 1989, the NBA added four teams (Heat, Hornets, Timberwolves, Magic) to the league, but where would they get their world-class players from overnight? In order to fulfill the need for these rosters, the NBA more or less made the impulse decision to load the new teams up with who they thought were the best available players. This essentially diluted the talent pool, primarily in MJ’s conference (three of the teams were from the East), whom he would play a majority of his games against, throughout the season and postseason.

Following their era of dominance in the '80s, the Lakers and the Celtics naturally found themselves in rebuilding mode in the early '90s because of the ebbs and flows of sports. Michael Jordan’s teams were able to take advantage of the lack of these powerhouses and won their first three-peat from 1990-93.

The NBA decided to add two more teams into the league (Grizzlies and Raptors) in 1995, the same time of MJ’s return, and he produced yet another championship three-peat. Conveniently, two of the three years ('95-96, '96-97) of that second triple-championship run took place when the league introduced a shortened 3-point line. From 1994-97, the NBA shortened the range of the 3-pointers from 23 feet 9 inches (22 in the corners) to 22 feet from anywhere around the arc. The change was implemented as a means to increase scoring. His 3-point shooting percentage increased from 35.2% in the year leading up to the change to 50%, 42.7% and 37.4% in the three years with the shortened line. There’s no denying that this change certainly aided Michael Jordan’s success in two of the six championship years, which would soon thereafter define his career.

4. LeBron’s Era of Heightened Competition With Super Teams and Player Movement

As much as Michael’s biggest fanatics might tell you the opposite, Michael never had to face the talent and athleticism that LeBron is faced with today. While LeBron is about to go into Round 4 with this Warriors' superteam, headlined by four All-Stars, Michael never faced a team in the finals with more than two All-Stars. In fact, half of his championships were against one-man teams like Drexler’s '92 Trailblazers or Malone’s '98 Jazz. LeBron’s opponents in the finals have included two or more All-Stars in seven out of his nine appearances with the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Going into tonight’s matchup, LeBron’s best teammates are All-Star Kevin Love, who is coming off his second concussion in the past three months, and 37-year-old Kyle Korver, who is known for his 3-point ability and not much else. This Warriors team is unlike anything we have ever seen before, headlined by four All-Stars, including two-time league MVP Stephen Curry, often considered the greatest shooter of all-time; MVP Kevin Durant; Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green; and Klay Thompson, who is also considered a top-five all-time 3-point shooter and a defensive anchor. Not to mention this Warriors squad has loads of depth, with former NBA Finals MVP and All-Star Andre Iguodala, the young and raw athleticism of Jordan Bell and the veteran leadership of Shaun Livingston and David West.

5. The Case for LeBron in the 2017-18 NBA Season

No one in the 15th season of their careers, at age 33, has accomplished what LeBron has done at such a consistent, dominating and efficient rate. He has averaged the most rebounds and assists of his career this season. Like a fine wine, he has only gotten better with age, with no signs of slowing down. He started and played in all 82 regular-season games and 18 playoff games, playing the most minutes in the NBA. This past Sunday against the Boston Celtics, James played 48 minutes in his 100th game of the 2017-18 season, posting a magnificent 35-15-9 performance, breaking the hearts of Boston fans and silencing his critics in Game 7 at TD Garden.

LeBron has willed his way to yet another NBA Finals appearance, his eighth straight, with what is often considered a mediocre supporting cast that is perhaps his worst team since the 2006-07 squad, which was swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.

On the journey to his eighth straight Finals appearance, LeBron has accomplished some never-before-seen feats. Against the Pacers in the first round, LeBron averaged at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 7 assists. No other player in NBA history has done that more than once. He also improved his career first-round record to 13-0. In the conference semifinals against Toronto, James became the NBA's all-time leader in postseason steals; his total prior to Game 1 of this Finals series sits at 414. Not to mention, he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and MJ for the most points in NBA playoff history with 6,775 prior to Game 1.

The case for the greatest NBA player of all-time may never be settled. But LeBron James is making an eloquent argument with each passing year.
