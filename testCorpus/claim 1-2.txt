Haddad Reaches 22%; Bolsonaro Loses in All Second Round Scenarios

Fernando Haddad (PT) gained six percentage points and cemented his position in second place in the presidential run, with 22%, according to a Datafolha poll done between September the 26th and 28th.

Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) is still the frontrunner, with 28%. But in second round simulation, he loses to all other candidates, including Haddad.

Both candidates also top voter rejection rankings. Bolsonaro's rejection increased from 43% to 46%, while Haddad's gone from 29% to 32%.

Ciro Gomes (PDT), with 11%, and Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB), with 11%, are technically tied in third. The margin of error is two points up or down.

The poll also shows that Bolsonaro and Haddad are technically tied among women, with 21% and 22% of voting intention, respectively. But while Bolsonaro's intention remained stable compared to previous polls, Haddad gained six points.

The frontrunner's rejection among women also increased: 52% now say they would not vote for Bolsonaro, from 49%. Haddad's rejection in this group rose from 24% to 26%.

Both candidates have highly confident voters: 79% of Bolsonaro's and 78% of Haddad's say they won't change their minds.
