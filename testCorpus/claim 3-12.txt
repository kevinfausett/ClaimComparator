Steve Kerr: Michael Jordan and LeBron James 'two best players that I've ever witnessed'
CLEVELAND — Add Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr's opinion to the Michael Jordan-LeBron James debate.

Kerr, who knows the greatness of these two players better than most having played alongside one and coached against the other, was candid in his praise of James following the Warriors' NBA Finals sweep of the Cavaliers on Friday night.

"I get asked all the time about MJ, LeBron, and it's such a difficult question to ask," Kerr said. "All I know is they're the two best players that I've ever witnessed. They're very different, but however you want to rank them, they're right there together."

Kerr's Warriors have run into James in the Finals for four consecutive years, and though this most recent series was the most lopsided of them all, Kerr isn't taking James' reign for granted. 

"Well, he's terrifying," Kerr said. "He really is. Every time he comes down the court, getting downhill, you just know he's either going to get to the rim or he's going to find one of his shooters for a three-point shot. He's added the three-point threat. When we came here three years ago in the first meeting, we weren't fearful of his shot. We were fearful of his power and his penetration and his passing, but now you fear everything.

"I think maybe the greatest testament to LeBron is that five years ago he was one of the top-five players of all time. From five years ago until now, it seems like he's ten times better, because he's added so much skill to his game."

Following Game 1 of this series, Kerr's praise was just as strong.

"They have a guy who is playing basketball at a level that I'm not sure anybody's ever seen before, when you consider everything he's doing," Kerr said. 

James, of course, had just completed one of the greatest Finals performances in league history, but his 51 points, eight rebounds and eight assists ultimately weren't enough, and the Cavs lost in devastating fashion.
