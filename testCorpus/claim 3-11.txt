CLEVELAND — LeBron James is the best basketball player of all time.

Wilt Chamberlain is second.

Michael Jordan is third.

There. That wasn’t so hard, was it?

This is just the opinion of one man who’s seen all the NBA stars who’ve played since 1962. I understand that GOAT discussions, like Mount Rushmore arguments, are a little tired these days, and much of the debate depends on how one frames the argument (estimable colleague Bob Ryan chooses to eliminate old-time centers from the discussion). So I’ll just tell you that LeBron is the best I have seen and this does not come lightly from one who grew up in a small New England town during an era when the Celtics were champions every spring.

We all know that Bill Russell is the greatest winner in sports history. Eleven championships in 13 seasons shuts down every argument. Russell’s Celtics routinely beat Wilt’s Warriors/Sixers/Lakers in the playoffs. But Russell had a lot more help than Wilt had. And no one could match Wilt’s physicality (7 feet 1 inch, 275 pounds) and skill set.

Chamberlain forever will be the most dominant player in the history of the sport. He still holds 72 NBA records. He won seven consecutive scoring titles and averaged 22.9 rebounds per game over 14 seasons (yes, it was a different game with a lot more missed shots). He almost never came out of a game, leading the league in minutes eight times. He averaged 50.4 points per game for the 1961-62 season. Think about that for a second: that means that if you score “only” 30 on a given night, you need 70 the next game to maintain your average. When Wilt decided to become a passer, he led the NBA in total assists in 1967-68.

Wilt forced rule changes. The paint (we called it “the key”) was widened because of Wilt. Offensive goaltending was invented by Wilt and banned by the NBA. When Wilt routinely dunked his free throws in high school, the practice was outlawed with a new regulation enforcing the free throw “plane.’’

I recall having this “greatest player ever” discussion with Larry Bird when Larry was in the middle of his three straight MVP seasons in the mid-1980s.

“I can answer that,’’ said Bird. “That’s easy. Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points. Bill Russell won 11 championships. It’s right there in the record books.’’

Dan Shaughnessy: NBA's all-time best? It's LeBron James
Bird always had good perspective about this. He pulled me aside after playing against Jordan for the first time. Jordan had scored 27 in a 20-point November loss to the Celtics in Chicago. Larry said, “That guy is the best player I ever played against. You just wait.’’

We didn’t have to wait long, and Jordan generally rules the GOAT discussion because of his 6-for-6 record in the Finals, his seven straight scoring titles (same as Wilt), his NBA-record 30.1 career scoring average, his awesome brand creation, and his well-earned reputation as the guy you always wanted taking the last shot. Jordan averaged 33.4 points per game in the playoffs.

I’d put the ball in Michael’s hands at the end of any close game, but LeBron has surpassed Jordan in my hoop dreams. Don’t think of it as a slight of Michael. Just think of it as the evolution of humanity. LeBron is bigger, stronger, a better rebounder, and a better passer than Jordan. Unlike Michael, LeBron can guard all five positions on the floor. He’s played the same number of seasons as Michael, but ranks ahead of Jordan in games, threes, rebounds, assists, triple-doubles, and all-NBA selections. He’s been to the Finals two more times than Jordan.

If you’re going to punish LeBron for going 3-6 in the Finals compared with Michael’s 6-0, then you’ll have to take Joe Montana’s 4-0 Super Bowl record over Tom Brady’s 5-3. If rings are the only measure, then Sam Jones (10) is the second-best player in NBA history.

There’s plenty to dislike about LeBron. He is a world-class diva, always complaining to the officials — even when up by 30 against the Celtics Saturday night. There’s a phony air about him. He’s quit on a couple of occasions and no one can defend the odious “Decision,” and the subsequent “not one, not two, not three” Miami smokeshow.

But if you don’t like watching him play basketball, that’s on you. At the age of 33, James is clearly still the best player in the world. Whether he gets the votes or not, he is the MVP of every NBA season, including this year’s. Close your eyes and try to imagine the 2017-18 Cavaliers without him. Hello, Lottery. And yet he’s threatening to take these bums back to the Finals for a fourth straight season — which would make it eight straight Finals for James.

The Full Monty of the LeBron experience has been on display in the first three games of this series. In Game 1 he was disinterested, “feeling out” the situation. He took only 16 shots, scored only 15 points, and had no interest in attacking the basket. Then he said he had “zero level of concern.’’

James’s Game 2 tour de force (42 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds) was not enough to beat the Celtics. It reminded me of Red Auerbach’s time-tested Chamberlain strategy of letting Wilt get his numbers while shutting down Wilt’s teammates and winning the game. LeBron’s response: “We’ll see what we’re made of on Saturday.’’

The King got his teammates involved in Saturday’s 30-point blowout win. He scored 12 of his 27 points in the first quarter, hit 8 of 12 shots overall, and made a couple of soul-crushing blocks. He dished out 12 assists, several of the spectacular variety, including a wraparound, no-look, lefty special to Tristan Thompson in traffic. He also — without putting the ball on the floor — threw down a double-clutch, reverse, two-handed dunk after taking a bounce pass from Kevin Love (the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s full-page photo of the slam featured a cutline that read, “No Celtics were harmed in the making of this dunk’’).

“Not many people can do that,’’ said Love.

Just like not many people can make the full-court-rush, wrong-foot, casual off-the-window runner to beat the Raptors in Game 3, and not many people can execute the chase-down block of Andre Iguodala that won the championship for The Land in 2016.

Don’t hate LeBron because he’s great. Just enjoy what you are seeing and stop fighting the notion that Wilt or Michael or Larry or Russell was better.

In 1962, the year Wilt averaged 50, the Celtics beat Chamberlain’s Warriors in seven games in the conference finals even though Wilt averaged 33 points and 26 rebounds for the series. In the 1986 playoffs, the Celts beat the Bulls when Michael let it rain for 63 points at the Old Garden.

LeBron is better than both . . . but the Celtics should still win this series.
