Climate Change - the REAL inconvenient truth: Scientist claims global warming is NATURAL

CLIMATE change is a natural phenomenon, according to a shock new report which throws a spanner in the works of those who say global warming is a result of man-made activity.

Well respected Australian scientist Jennifer Marohasy says global temperatures would have still risen without the industrial revolution – essentially dismissing the claim that man is responsible for climate change.

Most scientists will say climate change is caused by an increase of CO2 being ploughed into the atmosphere thanks to the industrial revolution.

But Dr Marohasy along with fellow scientist Dr John Abbot state this assumption is based on a model which was decided almost 120 years ago.

That model, mustered up by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius who is considered one of the godfathers of physical chemistry, claimed carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation.


While the fact that carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation is not disputed, what Dr Maloney and co argue is that it is not correlated correctly to a heating globe.

The scientists add little work has been done in the following century to update this model.

But to correctly analyse the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere, they began collecting data which offered ways to measure temperatures over the last 2,000 years such as tree rings and coral cores.


Dr Marohasy and Dr Abbot published a paper in the journal GeoResJ outlining their study of climate change using neural network technology.

They fed this data into a machine learning neural network which offered prediction patterns of temperatures for the last two millennia if there was not extra CO2.

The computer predicted temperatures which almost exactly match what global temperatures have been, even if there was not an industrial revolution.

They also found the world was warmer during the Medieval times.

Dr Marohasy wrote on her personal blog there would have also been a spike in temperatures from 1983-2012 – something which scientists have indeed observed.

The scientists says global warming is a natural phenomenon which heats the globe in cycles – much like how Ice Ages have cooled Earth throughout history.

In reference to her study published in GeoResJ, Dr Marohasy writes on her blog: “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates warming of approximately 1°C, but attributes this all to industrialisation.”

She adds: “To be clear, while mainstream climate science is replete with published proxy temperature studies showing that temperatures have cycled up and down over the last 2,000 years – spiking during the Medieval Warm Period and then again recently to about 1980 – the official IPCC reconstructions (which underpin the Paris Accord) deny such cycles. 

“Through this denial, leaders from within this much-revered community can claim that there is something unusual about current temperatures: that we have catastrophic global warming from industrialisation.”

Dr Marohasy, whose long list of credentials include setting up The Climate Modelling Laboratory and director of the Australian Environment Foundation until 2008, scathingly concludes: “The science is far from settled.”

However, Nasa, for one, has repeatedly stated that global warming is a result of human activity, saying that there is a “95 per cent probability” that it is caused by man.

Nasa’s Global Climate Change Office has said: “The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by Nasa. 

“There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.”
