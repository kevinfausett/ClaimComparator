Global Warming Is Natural, Not Man-Made

One of the fundamental
tenets of our justice system
is one is innocent until
proven guilty. While that doesn’t
apply to scientific discovery, in the
global warming debate the prevailing
attitude is that human
induced global warming is already
a fact of life and it is
up to d o u b t e r s t o
prove otherwise.
To complete the
analogy, I’ll add that
to date, there is no
credible evidence to
demonstrate that the climatological
changes we’ve seen since the
mid-1800’s are outside the bounds
of natural variability inherent in
the earth’s climate system.
Thus, any impartial jury
should not come back with a
“guilty” verdict convicting humanity
of forcing recent climatological
changes.
Even the most ardent supporters
of global warming will not
argue this point. Instead, they
argue that humans are only partially
responsible for the observed
climate change. If one takes a
hard look at the science involved,
their assertions appear to be
groundless.
First, carbon dioxide is not a
pollutant as many claim. Carbon
dioxide is good for plant life and is
a natural constituent of the
atmosphere. During Earth’s long
history there has been more and
less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
than we see today.
Second, they claim that climate
is stable and slow to change, and
we are accelerating climate
change beyond natural variability.
That is also not true.
Climate change is generally a
regional phenomenon and not a
global one. Regionally, climate has
been shown to change rapidly in
the past and will continue to do so
in the future. Life on earth will
adapt as it has always done. Life
on earth has been shown to thrive
when planetary temperatures are
warmer as opposed to colder.
Third, they point to recent
model projections that have
shown that the earth will warm
as much as 11 degrees Fahrenheit
over the next century.
One should be careful when
looking at model projections. After
all, these models are crude representations
of the real atmosphere
and are lacking many fundamental
processes and interactions
that are inherent in the real
atmosphere. The 11 degrees scenario
that is thrown around the
media as if it were the mainstream
prediction is an extreme
scenario.
Most models predict anywhere
from a 2 to 6 degree increase over
the next century, but even these
are problematic given the myriad
of problems associated with using
models and interpreting their
output.
No one advocates destruction
of the environment, and indeed
we have an obligation to take care
of our environment for future generations.
At the same time, we
need to make sound decisions
based on scientific facts.
My research leads me to
believe that we will not be able to
state conclusively that global
warming is or is not occurring for
another 30 to 70 years. We simply
don’t understand the climate system
well enough nor have the
data to demonstrate that humanity
is having a substantial impact
on climate change.
