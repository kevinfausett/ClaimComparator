Is LeBron James the GOAT? Forget the debate. It’s asking the wrong question.

Every time the NBA playoffs make us want to yawn, LeBron James swoops in and changes our reaction to mouths agape. We’re in awe of the best player in basketball doing best-player-in-basketball things, stretching his powers beyond perceived limitations and transforming the flawed Cleveland Cavaliers into the Finals contenders they shouldn’t be.

James isn’t merely living up to his kingly standard right now. The dude is acting out a script from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 11 postseason games so far, we’ve seen him bloodied, exhausted and nearly eliminated. And then we’ve seen him reattach his cape, make two game-winning shots, inspire spooked teammates and torment the top-seeded Toronto Raptors (again). All the while, he has demonstrated his knack for captivating a social media-obsessed audience, turning NBA Twitter into his playground and reigniting the endless GOAT debate.

LeBron James or Michael Jordan?

Back on that one, huh?

It’s fun, except when you find yourself yelling, nose to nose, with someone you just met over two superstars who never have and never will play an NBA game against each other. It’s also unfair to their greatness because, in order to have a preference and attempt to win an argument, you have to talk down one of the transcendent geniuses.

As someone who grew up watching Jordan and grew wise (I hope) watching James, I still think it’s easier, at this point, to laud Jordan as basketball’s invincible hero. He came first, and he possesses irrefutable accomplishments as the sport’s most deadly perimeter scorer, a six-time champion and a game-changing cultural phenomenon and celebrity endorser. And you’re also evaluating his playing career in totality; James probably has four or five good years left. It has been 20 years since Jordan pushed aside Bryon Russell and won the 1998 NBA Finals. It has been 15 years since his two-year comeback stint with the Washington Wizards ended. Time has provided the opportunity to digest Jordan and understand all layers of his significance.

On the other hand, James is still writing his story. It’s interesting that he was drafted in 2003, just months after Jordan retired for the final time, and since then, he has grown to be the game’s most important figure, even though legends such as Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Shaquille O’Neal had prime years left during his era.

Fifteen years later, James is 33 and still ascending. He has improved as a shooter and as a clutch player. And as a leader, he knows how to inspire resistance from a struggling team. As he showed in outlasting the Indiana Pacers over seven tough first-round games, he can say “Enough!” and lift his team out of situations that would be too difficult for most stars.

Unless a Boston Celtics squad missing Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward can stop him, James will carry the Cavaliers to their fourth straight Finals appearance and make his ridiculous eighth straight trek to the championship round. And he has done it with a team that Cleveland basically blew up at the trade deadline.

In the MJ-LeBron debate, many try to compare them in oversimplified ways. Jordan has six titles; James has three. Jordan won all six of his Finals appearances; James is 3 for 8. Jordan’s killer instinct was always on display; James likes being the nice guy. Jordan won all his championships in Chicago; James joined Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami in order to win his first two. Such comparisons go on and on, many of them anti-LeBron in tone, but they miss an essential point: LeBron never really wanted to be like Mike.

He wears No. 23 and hangs in the air. He sells a lot of sneakers and makes a lot of money off the court. But James didn’t strive to be the Air Apparent in the way that Bryant did. James did his own thing, and he is his own thing: the most skilled, athletic and powerful big man ever to play a little man’s game. In the era of position-less basketball, James is the most magnificent unicorn.

“He’s a guy we really haven’t seen before,” said Grant Hill, who will be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in September. “He’s a big, fast, strong, athletic man who has the size of a post player but plays like a guard. We had Magic [Johnson], but Magic was not athletic like him. LeBron is almost like Shaq because he’s so dominant with his size and athleticism. He’s very different from Michael in a lot of ways.”
